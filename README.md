# Memory Lane 

"Sounds like something that I used to feel" - The very first second of Two Ghosts by Harry Styles is the sound of feeling so unprepared for all that would never be again and all that would never be at all on the morning that I graduated high school.

There have been [inquiries](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2776393/) into both music and memory as they are attached to strong emotion, and thus as they are attached to one another. My Spotify playlists say a lot about me - not that I am as messy as they are, but that, without any intention of setting out to organize them this way, I have learned that I frequently listen to music to escape into times past. As a sample, one playlist folder is called "chronology," which such playlists as "2020: junior jitters" and "2019: sopht slump," named after my junior and sophomore years of college.  But even more, I frequently listen to music to escape into times that have never been, and some which likely will never be.

Memory Lane is an interface that allows you to attach your memory and your meaning to each song you listen to. Each memory and meaning is a location. You can go there - or remember why you don't want to. 

## A history: Memory Lane 1.0

Memory Lane is a project that I created for my User Interface Design class.
It adheres to various UI design principles, like information hierarchy and Jakob Nielsen's 10 heuristics for user interface design.

I built the first version of this Flask app with particular focus on building proficiency in JavaScript, Ajax, and routing. My initial commit is the fully finished project which I submitted for my midterm assessment.

Having built the app's UI already, I have decided to use Memory Lane to learn how to build and consume a RESTful API. In addition to building my own API which holds the memory text entered by the user, my second goal is to consume Spotify's API to access my own Spotify playlist information, so that I don't have to manually enter that information along with the memory information.

<!--# Memory Lane 2.0 is also the project which will initialize my first day in my [100 Days of Code goal, inspired by Jackie Luo](https://medium.com/@jackiehluo/a-year-of-code-c7bc1d4460cb).-->
