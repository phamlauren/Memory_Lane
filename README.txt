Memory Lane is a project that I created for my User Interface Design class.
It adheres to various UI design principles, like information hierarchy and Jakob Nielsen's 10 heuristics for user interface design.
I built the first version of this Flask app with particular focus on building proficiency in JavaScript, Ajax, and routing. My initial commit is the fully finished project which I submitted for my midterm assessment.
Having built the app's UI already, I have decided to use Memory Lane to learn how to build and consume a RESTful API.
Memory Lane 2.0 is also the project which will initialize my first day in my 100 Days of Code goal, inspired by Jackie Luo.
